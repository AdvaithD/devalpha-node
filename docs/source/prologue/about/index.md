# About

Vester is primarily intended for people who aren't professional mathematicians or researchers, but still want to put their programming skills to good use. I personally believe that there are a ton of good, intuitive and simple strategies which aren't available to hedge funds or high-frequency traders for whatever reasons, and hopefully Vester can aid you in finding those strategies.

## Inspiration

The framework is inspired by the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html">LMAX architecture</a> and built using <a href="http://redux.js.org">Redux</a> and some custom middleware.
